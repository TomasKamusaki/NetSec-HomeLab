Job Search Automation – Python Scripts

📌 Why I built this

While searching for my first SOC / IT support role, I was manually checking many job boards every day. It was slow, repetitive, and easy to miss new postings.
So I built small Python scripts to automate the process and collect fresh vacancies in one place.

🎯 What this project solves

 • Automatically searches job boards for entry-level IT / SOC roles
 
 • Focus on Spain (Valencia region) and remote jobs

 • Saves results into CSV files for easy review

 • Removes duplicates so I don’t apply twice

 • Helps track job opportunities during my cybersecurity learning journey

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
 
 • Python (requests, BeautifulSoup)
 
 • API usage (Adzuna)
 
 • Web scraping basics
 
 • CSV data handling

 • Automation mindset for real-life problems

Each script saves results into a CSV file.


📈 Result


This project saves time, improves consistency in job searching, and shows practical Python + automation skills relevant to SOC and IT work.
