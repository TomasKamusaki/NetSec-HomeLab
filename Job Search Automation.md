Job Search Automation – Python Scripts

📌 Why I built this

While searching for my first SOC / IT support role, I was manually checking many job boards every day. It was slow, repetitive, and easy to miss new postings.
So I built small Python scripts to automate the process and collect fresh vacancies in one place.

🎯 What this project solves

 • Automatically searches job boards for entry-level IT / SOC roles
 
 • Focus on Spain (Valencia region) and remote jobs

 • Saves results into CSV files for easy review

 • Removes duplicates so I don’t apply twice

 • Helps track job opportunities during my cybersecurity learning journey

🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
 
 • Python (requests, BeautifulSoup)
 
 • API usage (Adzuna)
 
 • Web scraping basics
 
 • CSV data handling

 • Automation mindset for real-life problems

📂 Scripts Included
 
 • job_search.py → Spain + Valencia jobs

 • remote_jobs.py → Remote job search
 
 • weworkremotely_jobs.py → Remote jobs from WeWorkRemotely

Each script saves results into a CSV file.
